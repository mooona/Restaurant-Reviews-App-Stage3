This is part one of the **Restaurant Reviews** project, I've converted the static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. I also worked on enhancing the accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use.I tried to enhance the user experience for my website users by trying to make the info visualised and readable. I also added a service worker as a start for the process of creating a seamless offline experience for my users.
